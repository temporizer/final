	Hi, My name is Jino Conklin. I am a Web Developer. I am currently attending Clark College in Vancouver, Washington acquiring my Associates in Applied Tech in Web Development.
	</p>
	<p>I have been interested in computers my while life. In the last 8 or so years, I have gotten into the web. I have made many single static pages and multi-page sites, mainly for myself and my personal enjoyment. Since starting at Clark, I have delved into more dynamic pages and scripting languages.</p>

		I am a father to 4 beautiful children. They are my world. In my free time I enjoy playing pool, hanging out with my friends (I know a lot of people but just a handful of them I can call friends, true friends), anything outdoors, from hiking to biking to swimming to just soaking up the rays on a nice day (I live in Washington so the nice days are far and few between, so when the day is nice, i'm outside).
	</p>
	<p>
		I love to help people. I am caring, trustworthy, outgoing, I learn fast and absorb everything. I do have a curse and a blessing all in one though: I see everything. It can be a curse because, well, seeing everything is distracting sometimes. It's more of a blessing though, because I see everything. Not a lot gets past me.
